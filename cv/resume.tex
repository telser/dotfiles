\section{Education}

\title{(Unfinished) Ph.D. Computer Science}
\employer{\llap{Emory University}}
\dates{August 2012 -- November 2013}
\begin{position}
I focused on algorithms and discrete mathematics. Specifically, graph
algorithms and network theory applications to software. I left before
finishing to take a break from academia.
\end{position}

\title{B.Sc. Computer Science}
\employer{Southern Polytechnic State University \\ GPA 3.68}
\dates{January 2008 -- August 2012}
\begin{position}
I focused on functional programming, using Haskell for projects when
permitted. My senior project was on using artificial intelligence to
improve testing of table top games. Further, I completed a project for
converting medical codes.
\end{position}

\title{B.Sc. Mathematics}
\employer{Southern Polytechnic State University \\ GPA 3.68 }
\dates{January 2008 -- August 2012}
\begin{position}
I concurrently completed a seperate degree in Mathematics. My senior
project covered financial mathematics. Specifically comparing
sinusoidal volatility in the Black-Scholes equation with Generalized
Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedacity.
\end{position}
