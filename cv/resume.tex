\section{Education}

\title{(Unfinished) Computer Science}
\employer{\llap{Emory University}}
\dates{August 2012 -- November 2013}
\begin{position}
I focused on algorithms and discrete mathematics. Specifically, graph
algorithms and network theory applications to software. I left before
finishing to take a break from academia.
\end{position}

\title{B.Sc. Computer Science}
\employer{Southern Polytechnic State University \\ GPA 3.68}
\dates{January 2008 -- August 2012}
\begin{position}
I focused on functional programming, using Haskell for projects when
permitted. My senior project was on using artificial intelligence to
improve testing of table top games. Further, I completed a project for
converting medical codes.
\end{position}

\title{B.Sc. Mathematics}
\employer{Southern Polytechnic State University \\ GPA 3.68 }
\dates{January 2008 -- August 2012}
\begin{position}
I concurrently completed a seperate degree in Mathematics. My senior
project covered predictive analytics specifically in financial
mathematics. Specifically comparing sinusoidal volatility in the
Black-Scholes equation with Generalized Autoregressive Conditional
Heteroskedacity.
\end{position}

\subsection{Remunerated}

\title{Software Engineer}
\employer{\llap{Clickscape}}
\dates{December 2013 -- Present}
\begin{position}
  Software development in Clojure, Haskell, and Javascript. Part of a
  small team where resposiblities for new features, maintence,
  testing, and deployment are all shared. The main product is an event
  driven system, with RESTful services to an Angular display. A
  secondary task involved maintence, and the occasional new feature
  addtion, of a Ruby on Rails 2.3 application. Development of set of
  services to replace the Rails application using Haskell is underway.
  Personal highlights include, championing the use of Haskell,
  development of Leiningen plugins for codebase analysis and reporting
  as well as setup/implementation of JIRA.\\ \ \\
 Programming languages employed include Clojure, Haskell, Javascript,
 and Ruby. \\ \ \\
 Technologies used included Amazon tools (EC2, S3, Opsworks, etc.),
 Angular, Cabal, CassandraDB, Core.Typed, Elastic Search, Git, JIRA,
 PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Ruby on Rails, Selenium, SQLite3.
