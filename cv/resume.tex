\title{Projects}
\employer{\llap{Emory University}}
\dates{2012 -- 2013}
\begin{position}
While at Emory I worked on several projects. These included technologies such as C/C+, Clojure, CUDA, DB2, PostgreSQL, and RPC.
\end{position}

\title{Projects}
\employer{\llap{Southern Polytechnic State University}}
\dates{2008 -- 2012}
\begin{position}
As an undergraduate, I had several projects including:
\begin{itemize}
\item [Computer Science Senior Project] This project was research into using artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning, to enhance testing of table top games. The results of the work were presented at the end of the semester.

\item[Mathematics Senior Project] This project investigated non-constant volatility in the Black-Scholes stock option model. Specifically a focus was given to modeling volatility with sinusoidal functions. Finally a comparison was made to the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedacity (GARCH) model, using data published by JP Morgan. Technologies employed for this project included: Haskell and gnuplot.

\item[Software Engineering Project] This was a team project in which I acted as lead developer. We produced a product that would translate medical codes from an outgoing code standard (ICD-9) to a newer version (ICD-10) for a client outside of the university. Technologies that we employed included C++, Qt, SQLite, and googletest. My specific responsibilities on the team, were client interaction for requirement analysis, technology usage decisions, project architecture and implementation.

\item[Database Project] This was a team project to create an auction website that used PostgreSQL. We used custom php, javascript, html, and css, along with PostgreSQL. My role was database design and interaction including creating the schema and all interactions to the database.

\item[Statistical Packages Comparison] This was a project that studied the applications of statistics in applications. A comparison was made between Matlab, Maple, R, SPS, and Mathematica detailing flexibility, usage for statistics, and other parameters. This resulted in, medium depth usage, of each of the packages listed above.
\end{itemize}
\end{position}

\title{Talks}
\employer{\llap{Southern Polytechnic State University}}
\dates{2012}
\begin{position}
I presented work from SPSU at a pair of conferences.
\begin{itemize}
\item[MAA] I presented the work I was doing on my mathematics senior project during the south-east regional section meeting of the Mathematical Association of America. This was a 20 minute presentation followed by questions.
\item[Polytechnic Summit] I presented the final results of my mathematics senior project at the Polytechnic Summit in August of 2012. This was a poster presentation with a question and answer section.
\end{itemize}
\end{position}
