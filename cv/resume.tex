\section{Education}

\title{(Unfinished) Computer Science}
\employer{\llap{Emory University}}
\dates{August 2012 -- November 2013}
\begin{position}
I focused on algorithms and discrete mathematics. Specifically, graph
algorithms and network theory applications to software. I left before
finishing to take a break from academia.
\end{position}

\title{B.Sc. Computer Science}
\employer{Southern Polytechnic State University \\ GPA 3.68}
\dates{January 2008 -- August 2012}
\begin{position}
I focused on functional programming, using Haskell for projects when
permitted. My senior project was on using artificial intelligence to
improve testing of table top games. Further, I completed a project for
converting medical codes.
\end{position}

\title{B.Sc. Mathematics}
\employer{Southern Polytechnic State University \\ GPA 3.68 }
\dates{January 2008 -- August 2012}
\begin{position}
I concurrently completed a seperate degree in Mathematics. My senior
project covered predictive analytics specifically in financial
mathematics. Specifically comparing sinusoidal volatility in the
Black-Scholes equation with Generalized Autoregressive Conditional
Heteroskedacity.
\end{position}

\subsection{Remunerated}

\title{Software Engineer}
\employer{\llap{Clickscape}}
\dates{December 2013 -- Present}
\begin{position}
  Polyglot software development mainly with Clojure, Erlang, and Javascript.
  Minor development using Haskell, with operation support using Python.
  Developer reporting directly to the CTO and CEO with resposiblities for greenfield
  development, new features, maintence, testing, and deployment. Main development is
  a distributed system with components written in Erlang and Clojure along with two separate
  interfaces, both web based, one using Angular and the other Javascript without use of a framework.
  Personal highlights include leading a switch from Cassandra to PostgreSQL,
  moving all servers to FreeBSD from a mix of Amazon Linux and Ubuntu, implementing
  monitoring and deep reporting with the Riemann event system from the Erlang
  and Clojure codebases, development of Leiningen plugins for codebase analysis and reporting,
  developing continuous deployment mechanisms for the Erlang code,
  as well as re-architecting AWS server and service usage resulting in spending reduction.\\ \ \\
 Programming languages employed include Clojure, Erlang, Haskell, Javascript,
 Python, and Ruby. \\ \ \\
 Technology highlights include: Amazon tools (EC2, S3, Cloudformation, etc.),
 Angular, Cabal, Elastic Search, FreeBSD, Git, Leiningen, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ,
 Rebar, Relx, Riemann, Selenium, SQLite3.
